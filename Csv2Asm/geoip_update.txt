Updating GeoIP database
-----------------------

1. Download GeoIP.csv from: https://www.hackitu.de/geoip_lookup/

2. Copy GeoIP.csv into Csv2Asm directory

3. If you want to edit the IP ranges from GeoIP.csv make sure all ranges remain sorted

4. Execute csv2asm.exe and it will do the following:

	- generates geoip_c.h
	- displays a message box with number of different IP ranges detected

5. Overwrite geoip_c.h located in "or" directory with the new one from Csv2Asm
