	ShowURL version 1.00

This plugin shows the complete URLs that are used with HTTP proxy requests. To use it, copy ShowURL.dll to the AdvTor-plugins directory.

Version 1.00 doesn't detect proxy chains, and it doesn't skip socks4/5 negotiation, so the client must be set to send HTTP proxy requests.
