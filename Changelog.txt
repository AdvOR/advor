- corrected a memory leak in parse_request_headers()
- corrected an infinite loop that could had been caused by using "--select-exit" without specifying an exit node

- the "A1" country that has IP ranges blacklisted by MaxMind is shown using the approximated country followed by an asterisk in node selection dialogs and in the "OR network" dialog
- country bans and the restriction to build circuits with IPs from different countries are verified using the approximated country instead of GeoIP's fake "A1" country (this solves a security problem where a circuit like US-DE-A1 where A1=US could had been built)
- router selection dialogs no longer display "Anonymous Proxy" as a valid country
- new option on the "Banned routers" page: "Do not use exits that were blacklisted by MaxMind's GeoIP" that can be enabled when country restrictions enforced by some websites can't be bypassed because the website is using a GeoIP having blacklisted IP ranges

2012-11-03 Advanced Onion Router 0.3.0.13

- corrected: when remapping an address, if a plugin exported AdvTor_TranslateAddress(), the new_address part of an addressmap_entry_t structure was freed without undating it with the new remapped address; this error caused random crashes when a plugin that exported AdvTor_TranslateAddress() (like the Blacklist plugin) was loaded (thanks to anonymous for reporting this error on sf.net)
- the value for the source code file name pointer is written to AdvOR-crash.txt instead of the file name pointed by it
- AdvOR.dll increases the reference count for WS2_32.dll to prevent an intercepted application from unloading it
- if more plugins export TranslateAddress and have the right to translate addresses, the address that was remapped by plugins is rewritten only once, after all event handlers are called
- AdvOR no longer formats useless controller messages if no controller is connected
- updated libraries: libevent-2.0.20-stable, openssl-1.0.1c

- address map registrations are now scheduled when they are changed from the "Associate addresses" page
- new configuration option: SocksAuthenticator
- new option on the "Proxy" page: "User:password" (SocksAuthenticator) that allows restricting the access to the local proxy with an username:password combination (all proxy protocols are supported)

- [tor-0.2.2.38] Avoid an uninitialized memory read when reading a vote or consensus document that has an unrecognized flavor name. This read could lead to a remote crash bug. Fixes bug 6530; bugfix on 0.2.2.6-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.38] Try to leak less information about what relays a client is choosing to a side-channel attacker. Previously, a Tor client would stop iterating through the list of available relays as soon as it had chosen one, thus finishing a little earlier when it picked a router earlier in the list. If an attacker can recover this timing information (nontrivial but not proven to be impossible), they could learn some coarse-grained information about which relays a client was picking (middle nodes in particular are likelier to be affected than exits). The timing attack might be mitigated by other factors (see bug 6537 for some discussion), but it's best not to take chances. Fixes bug 6537; bugfix on 0.0.8rc1. 
- new hot keys: "Hide all intercepted applications" and "Un-hide and resume hidden applications" (they are mutually exclusive: when one is pressed, it is unregistered and the other is registered)
- new configuration options: HotkeyHideAll (default is `, disabled), HotkeyRestoreAll (default is Win+Ctrl+7, disabled)
- new options on the "System" page: "Hide all intercepted applications" (HotkeyHideAll), "Pause hidden applications" (HotkeyHideAll) and "Un-hide and resume hidden applications" (HotkeyRestoreAll)

- [tor-0.2.2.37] Work around a bug in OpenSSL that broke renegotiation with TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2. Without this workaround, all attempts to speak the v2 Tor connection protocol when both sides were using OpenSSL 1.0.1 would fail. Resolves ticket 6033.
- [tor-0.2.2.37] When waiting for a client to renegotiate, don't allow it to add any bytes to the input buffer. This fixes a potential DoS issue. Fixes bugs 5934 and 6007; bugfix on 0.2.0.20-rc.
- [tor-0.2.2.37] Fix an edge case where if we fetch or publish a hidden service descriptor, we might build a 4-hop circuit and then use that circuit for exiting afterwards -- even if the new last hop doesn't obey our ExitNodes config option. Fixes bug 5283; bugfix on 0.2.0.10-alpha.

- [tor-0.2.2.36] Change IP address for maatuska (v3 directory authority).
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Change IP address for ides (v3 directory authority), and rename it to turtles.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] When building or running with any version of OpenSSL earlier than 0.9.8s or 1.0.0f, disable SSLv3 support. These OpenSSL versions have a bug (CVE-2011-4576) in which their block cipher padding includes uninitialized data, potentially leaking sensitive information to any peer with whom they make a SSLv3 connection. Tor does not use SSL v3 by default, but a hostile client or server could force an SSLv3 connection in order to gain information that they shouldn't have been able to get. The best solution here is to upgrade to OpenSSL 0.9.8s or 1.0.0f (or later). But when building or running with a non-upgraded OpenSSL, we disable SSLv3 entirely to make sure that the bug can't happen.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Never use a bridge or a controller-supplied node as an exit, even if its exit policy allows it. Found by wanoskarnet. Fixes bug 5342. Bugfix on 0.1.1.15-rc (for controller-purpose descriptors) and 0.2.0.3-alpha (for bridge-purpose descriptors).
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Only build circuits if we have a sufficient threshold of the total descriptors that are marked in the consensus with the "Exit" flag. This mitigates an attack proposed by wanoskarnet, in which all of a client's bridges collude to restrict the exit nodes that the client knows about. Fixes bug 5343.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Provide controllers with a safer way to implement the cookie authentication mechanism. With the old method, if another locally running program could convince a controller that it was the Tor process, then that program could trick the contoller into telling it the contents of an arbitrary 32-byte file. The new "SAFECOOKIE" authentication method uses a challenge-response approach to prevent this attack. Fixes bug 5185; implements proposal 193.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Avoid logging uninitialized data when unable to decode a hidden service descriptor cookie. Fixes bug 5647; bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Avoid a client-side assertion failure when receiving an INTRODUCE2 cell on a general purpose circuit. Fixes bug 5644; bugfix on 0.2.1.6-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Fix the SOCKET_OK test that we use to tell when socket creation fails so that it works on Win64. Fixes part of bug 4533; bugfix on 0.2.2.29-beta. Bug found by wanoskarnet.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Reject out-of-range times like 23:59:61 in parse_rfc1123_time(). Fixes bug 5346; bugfix on 0.0.8pre3.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Make our number-parsing functions always treat too-large values as an error, even when those values exceed the width of the underlying type. Previously, if the caller provided these functions with minima or maxima set to the extreme values of the underlying integer type, these functions would return those values on overflow rather than treating overflow as an error. Fixes part of bug 5786; bugfix on 0.0.9.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Correct parsing of certain date types in parse_http_time(). Without this patch, If-Modified-Since would behave incorrectly. Fixes bug 5346; bugfix on 0.2.0.2-alpha. Patch from Esteban Manchado Velazques.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Change the BridgePassword feature (part of the "bridge community" design, which is not yet implemented) to use a time-independent comparison. The old behavior might have allowed an adversary to use timing to guess the BridgePassword value. Fixes bug 5543; bugfix on 0.2.0.14-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Detect and reject certain misformed escape sequences in configuration values. Previously, these values would cause us to crash if received in a torrc file or over an authenticated control port. Bug found by Esteban Manchado Velazquez, and independently by Robert Connolly from Matta Consulting who further noted that it allows a post-authentication heap overflow. Patch by Alexander Schrijver. Fixes bugs 5090 and 5402 (CVE 2012-1668); bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] When sending an HTTP/1.1 proxy request, include a Host header. Fixes bug 5593; bugfix on 0.2.2.1-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Fix a NULL-pointer dereference on a badly formed SETCIRCUITPURPOSE command. Found by mikeyc. Fixes bug 5796; bugfix on 0.2.2.9-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] If we hit the error case where routerlist_insert() replaces an existing (old) server descriptor, make sure to remove that server descriptor from the old_routers list. Fix related to bug 1776. Bugfix on 0.2.2.18-alpha.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Directory authorities now reject versions of Tor older than 0.2.1.30, and Tor versions between 0.2.2.1-alpha and 0.2.2.20-alpha inclusive. These versions accounted for only a small fraction of the Tor network, and have numerous known security issues. Resolves issue 4788.
- [tor-0.2.2.36] Feature removal: When sending or relaying a RELAY_EARLY cell, we used to convert it to a RELAY cell if the connection was using the v1 link protocol. This was a workaround for older versions of Tor, which didn't handle RELAY_EARLY cells properly. Now that all supported versions can handle RELAY_EARLY cells, and now that we're enforcing the "no RELAY_EXTEND commands except in RELAY_EARLY cells" rule, remove this workaround. Addresses bug 4786.

2011-12-17 Advanced Onion Router 0.3.0.6

- [tor-0.2.2.35] (this change was not applied because AdvOR already had a better fix since 0.3.0.4b) Fix a heap overflow bug that could occur when trying to pull data into the first chunk of a buffer, when that chunk had already had some data drained from it. Fixes CVE-2011-2778; bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. Reported by "Vektor".
- [tor-0.2.2.35] Initialize Libevent with the EVENT_BASE_FLAG_NOLOCK flag enabled, so that it doesn't attempt to allocate a socketpair.

- updated language strings: 2930

2011-07-22 Advanced Onion Router 0.3.0.1

- new page: "HTTP headers" with options related to changing HTTP headers and showing HTTP requests and replies with or without full headers (LOG_NOTICE for headers, LOG_INFO for full HTTP traffic, original and adjusted)
- setting a public proxy in a client and intercepting it will cause AdvOR to chain the OR exit with that proxy (to bypass Tor blacklists)
- if proxy chains are detected, all requests for all proxies are rewritten to apply all configured restrictions for each proxy in a chain
- if Opera Turbo traffic is detected in a proxy chain, Opera's unique identifier and the screen resolution that are sent to the Opera Turbo servers are replaced with identity-dependent random values
- added support for keep-alive HTTP connections

- when the option to show full request headers is enabled, all HTTP traffic, including POST data, is logged if the log level is greater than "[6] Proxy"
- corrected: some settings from the "HTTP headers" page were not saved to AdvOR.ini (thanks to Rex for reporting this problem) (AdvOR 0.3.0.1 test 5)
- added restrictions for minimum widths and heights for all child dialogs
- added scroll bars for all child dialogs that are resized to dimensions smaller than minimum accepted values (requested by TT)
- the Blacklist plugin was updated to add support for scroll bars

- updated language strings: 2896, 2897, 2898, 2899, 2900, 2901, 2902, 2903, 2904, 2905, 2906, 2907, 2908, 2909, 2910, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2914, 2915, 2916, 2917, 2918, 2919, 2920, 2921, 2922, 2923, 2924, 2925, 2926, 2927, 2928, 2929

2011-07-03 Advanced Onion Router 0.3.0.0

- corrected: the parameter "--verify-lng" expected a language name instead of a language file name; now both are accepted (thanks to mamont for reporting this problem)

- if the option "Always on top" is enabled, popup message boxes are created with the MB_TOPMOST style
- new functions for plugins: lang_get_string(), lang_change_dialog_strings() and a new event for plugins: AdvTor_LanguageChange()
- the Blacklist plugin is updated to version 1.02 with multi-language support; added an example language file Blacklist-English.lng
- when hibernation mode is enabled, all connection requests from all intercepted processes are rejected and logged
- the list with child dialogs was replaced with a tree view

- added support for deleting cookies saved by Internet Explorer, Chrome, Safari, Opera and Firefox when changing identities; cookie deletion procedures attempt to invoke browser API's via remote threads
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on June 2nd
- the procedure that downloads bridges from https://bridges.torproject.org was rewritten to work with invalid certificates received from https://bridges.torproject.org
- when disabling http/https proxies from the "Authorities" dialog, proxy addresses are no longer removed from configuration (requested by ktwh)
- corrected: the function tor_malloc() was replaced with GlobalAlloc() which is thread-safe in procedures that convert UTF-8 language strings for GUI items (thanks to mamont for reporting this problem)
- new option on the "Bypass ISP filtering" page: "Allow invalid certification authorities for bridges.torproject.org" (default is disabled for security reasons; downloading the list of bridges fails when this option is disabled if Internet Explorer can't verify the certificate up to a trusted authority - when using WinInet functions for IE 6 on Windows XP SP2/3)
- if the language strings 0 and/or 1248 contain links to torproject.org they are removed because some translations say torproject.org is the official website for AdvOR (complaints were received from torproject.org that some users ask them about AdvTor/AdvOR problems instead of using our forums)
- corrected: buffer overflow in plugin_load_lng() (thanks to mamont for reporting this problem)
- corrected: UNICODE language files were not converted to UTF-8
- the resource file was updated to include the option "Allow invalid certification authorities from certificates for bridges.torproject.org"
- updated language strings: 1, 36, 50, 54, 59, 61, 97, 109, 110, 115, 117, 128, 130, 143, 144, 2677, 2799, 2800, 2801, 2802, 2803, 2804, 2805, 2806, 2807, 2808, 2809, 2810, 2811, 2812, 2813, 2814, 2815, 2816, 2817, 2818, 2819, 2820, 2821, 2822, 2823, 2824, 2825, 2826, 2827, 2828, 2829, 2830, 2831, 2832, 2833, 2834, 2835, 2836, 2837, 2838, 2839, 2840, 2841, 2842, 2843, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2847, 2848, 2849, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2855, 2856, 2857, 2858, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2863, 2864, 2865, 2866, 2867, 2868, 2869, 2870, 2871, 2872, 2873, 2874, 2875
- added mamont's changes to AdvOR-english.lng for special GUI effects (updated language strings: 47, 53, 57, 59, 60, 62, 1248, 2804, 2805, 2817)

2011-05-06 Advanced Onion Router 0.2.0.12

- corrected: when an UNICODE language file was loaded, list view subitems for hidden services and plugins  were not updated
- corrected: since language files were loaded using read_file_to_str(), language files were opened in text mode and had CRLF (\r\n) converted to LF (\n), which caused multi-line debug messages to be converted to single-line messages
- the restriction for minimum circuit bandwidth rate now uses BandwidthCapacity instead of BandwidthRate (it uses what the router is known to handle instead of what the router reported it can handle)
- the window title will show "Disconnected" when disconnecting from the OR network (suggested by TT)
- new option for circuit context menus on the "Network information" page: "Priority", which is used when deciding which circuits to use for a new client connection when more circuits with different priorities exist; low priority circuits are used only when no higher priority circuits are available
- new option for circuit context menus on the "Network information" page: "Availability" which can be used to change expiration times or to prevent a manually built circuit from expiring (the default expiration time can be changed from the "Circuit build" page)
- new option on the "System" page: "Encrypt all settings using AES"; if this option is enabled, all configuration files are gzipped and encrypted using a password or a key file and saved to AdvOR.dat, original configuration files are deleted; to revert the encryption and to save plain-text configuration files, after a successfull login, the encryption can be disabled from the System dialog
- new functions for plugins: tor_malloc(), tor_free(), safe_malloc(), safe_free() (the "safe" functions attempt to allocate memory that is not cached to the Windows swap file)
- new functions for plugins: write_protected_file(), append_to_protected_file(), read_protected_file(), protected_file_exists(); if encrypting configuration files is enabled, "protected files" are gzipped and encrypted and saved to AdvOR.dat
- an example plugin (C) that uses protected file operations was included in the source code archive - Notes.dll (a simple text editor which saves a text file to AdvOR.dat when encryption is enabled, and "AdvOR--notes.txt" when encryption is disabled)
- an example plugin (asm) that uses AdvTor_HandleRead() was included in the source code archive - ShowURL.dll (a plugin that shows the complete URLs used with HTTP proxy requests)
- new functions for plugins: tor_gzip_compress(), tor_gzip_uncompress(), tor_zlib_new(), tor_zlib_process(), tor_zlib_free(), detect_compression_method()
- the plugin Blacklist.dll can now download and uncompress gzipped blacklists
- updated language strings: 2777, 2778, 2779, 2780, 2781, 2782, 2783, 2784, 2785, 2786, 2787, 2788, 2789, 2790, 2791, 2792, 2793, 2794, 2795, 2796, 2797, 2798

2011-04-25 Advanced Onion Router 0.2.0.11

- corrected: if an invalid hostname was requested, the connection state was not set (thanks to RoLex for reporting this error)
- the function CreateNewProcess() returns a process handle for the process that was created
- new configuration option: SynchronizeExit which can have QuickStart menu items as parameters, to start applications and to wait for them to terminate, then exit, or to exit when any of the SynchronizeExit applications exits, also terminating all intercepted processes (for situations where AdvOR is only needed for one application)
- added instructions on how to use the Tor Browser bundle from torproject.org with AdvOR and a sample AdvOR.ini to AdvOR\Tor-info\Firefox (readme.txt and AdvOR.ini).
- added instructions on how to use Opera as a portable "Tor Browser" and a sample AdvOR.ini to AdvOR\Tor-info\Opera (readme.txt and AdvOR.ini).

2011-04-23 Advanced Onion Router 0.2.0.10

- corrected: when the option to verify AS paths was enabled, the option to avoid using nodes from same countries was no longer used
- all file I/O operations were moved to file_io.c
- all stdio file operations were replaced with Win32 UNICODE-enabled API; AdvOR can now open files that have non-ANSI characters in their file names or in their paths
- all process intercetion functions were modified to support UNICODE process names, module names and UNICODE file names / paths
- all AdvOR files can be renamed to file names that have non-ANSI characters (the "AdvOR" prefix can be replaced with any UNICODE prefix)
- new command line parameter: --read-only which prevents modifying / saving configuration files (if AdvOR is running from a read-only or write-protected location)
- when the read-only mode is enabled, the options to save settings and to save logs  are disabled and all file operations are emulated
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on April 3rd
- updated language strings: 0046

2011-04-02 Advanced Onion Router 0.2.0.9

- corrected: AdvOR.dll was checking for the old signature "AdvTor" instead of "AdvOR" when releasing intercepted processes
- corrected: the options to avoid using in same circuit nodes from same subnets and countries are no longer disabled when enabling the option to avoid AS path intersections
- the code was restructured to get rid of all goto's inherited from Tor; some functions were optimized and some memory leaks were corrected
- directory servers running AdvOR no longer accept requests for "/tor/bytes.txt", "/tor/mallinfo.txt" and "/tor/dbg-stability.txt" ; requests for them will result in 404 errors
- new configuation option: Confirmations; currently it is used to configure confirmation dialogs that are shown at exit and when closing non-proxy connections of an intercepted process
- when changing the identity, more information is shown about the new identity when possible
- the option "Circuit timeout when exiting program" was moved from the Circuit Build page to the "Become a Server" page as "Circuit timeout when entering hibernation"; this made room for a new option,
- new configuration option: CircuitBandwidthRate (default is disabled), which is used to configure the minimum required bandwidth rate for circuits
- new option on the Circuit Build page: "Minimum circuit bandwidth rate"; if this option is enabled, all circuits will be built with routers that have the minimum required bandwidth rate
- updated language strings: 123, 2690, 2767, 2768, 2769, 2770, 2771, 2772, 2773, 2774, 2775, 2776

2011-03-18 Advanced Onion Router 0.2.0.8

- added: new parameter for connection_t structures, timestamp_lastcircuit, which must be greater than get_time()-MIN_CIRCUIT_PER_CONNECTION_TIME (default is 2 seconds); this verification prevents routers with fake policies from causing too many circuits for same connection to be build in a small period of time
- AS paths for all routers are shown on the Network Information page when selecting a router from the circuit tree
- estimated AS paths and AS path intersections for circuits are shown on the Network Information page when selecting a circuit from the circuit tree
- new option on the Router Restrictions page: "Estimate AS paths and avoid AS path intersections" to solve some of the problems described at http://blog.torproject.org/blog/research-problem-measuring-safety-tor-network

2011-03-06 AdvTor 0.2.0.7

- [tor-0.2.1.30] Stop sending a CLOCK_SKEW controller status event whenever we fetch directory information from a relay that has a wrong clock. Instead, only inform the controller when it's a trusted authority that claims our clock is wrong. Bugfix on 0.1.2.6-alpha; fixes the rest of bug 1074.
- [tor-0.2.1.30] Fix a bounds-checking error that could allow an attacker to remotely crash a directory authority. Bugfix on 0.2.1.5-alpha. Found by "piebeer".
- [tor-0.2.1.30] If relays set RelayBandwidthBurst but not RelayBandwidthRate, Tor would ignore their RelayBandwidthBurst setting, potentially using more bandwidth than expected. Bugfix on 0.2.0.1-alpha. Reported by Paul Wouters. Fixes bug 2470.
- [tor-0.2.1.30] Adjust our TLS Diffie-Hellman parameters to match those used by Apache's mod_ssl.
- [tor-0.2.1.30] Check for and reject overly long directory certificates and directory tokens before they have a chance to hit any assertions. Bugfix on 0.2.1.28. Found by "doorss".
- [tor-0.2.1.30] Bring the logic that gathers routerinfos and assesses the acceptability of circuits into line. This prevents a Tor OP from getting locked in a cycle of choosing its local OR as an exit for a path (due to a .exit request) and then rejecting the circuit because its OR is not listed yet. It also prevents Tor clients from using an OR running in the same instance as an exit (due to a .exit request) if the OR does not meet the same requirements expected of an OR running elsewhere. Fixes bug 1859; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on March 2nd
- updated language strings: 2763

2011-03-05 AdvTor 0.2.0.6

- new configuration options: HotkeyRestore (default is Win+Ctrl+T, disabled), HotkeyNewIdentity (default is Win+N, disabled), HotkeyIntercept(default is Win+Ctrl+I, disabled), HotkeyRelease (default is Win+Ctrl+R, disabled)) (requested by jimjum)
- settings related to hot keys were added to the System dialog ("Hide / restore Advanced TOR window", "New identity", "Intercept focused application", "Release focused application")
- added: new option on exit node selection dialog: "Exit selection algorithm uses consecutive displayed nodes from this list", which updates IdentityFlags (disabled by default); this option affects chosen exits; if this option is enabled, AdvTor will always use a fixed exit that is changed only when choosing a new identity (requested by jimjum)
- the blacklist plugin no longer shows a warning if it cannot load blacklist.txt (the log level was changed from LOG_WARN to LOG_INFO)
- updated language strings: 2737, 2738, 2739, 2740, 2741, 2742, 2743, 2744, 2745, 2746, 2747, 2748, 2749, 2750, 2751, 2752, 2753, 2754, 2755, 2756, 2757, 2758, 2759, 2760, 2761, 2762

2011-02-12 AdvTor 0.2.0.5

- corrected: if all options related to publishing router descriptor were disabled, the dialog initialization procedure for the "Become a Server" dialog was initializing publishing options from a null pointer (thanks to jimjum for reporting this error)
- corrected: if no name servers can be found when connecting to Tor network and Server mode is enabled, name servers will be configured at a later time (thanks to jimjum for reporting this error)
- corrected: the function retry_all_listeners() was called while initializing dialog controls for the "Become a Server" dialog (thanks to jimjum for reporting this error)
- corrected: changes from the "Become a Server" dialog that have non-reentrant calls to user32 and winsock32 functions are applied by run_scheduled_events() instead of being applied directly (thanks to jimjum for reporting this error)
- corrected: the list with server descriptor settings was not re-initialized after clearing it (thanks to jimjum for reporting this error)
- corrected: if no memory is allocated for packed_cell_t objects, statistics for cell pool memory usage are no longer logged
- when best time delta is changed, timestamps for all existing connections are adjusted to be relative to current fake local time
- the bandwith rate for banned routers is no longer shown in router selection dialogs
- if the router list is sorted, all routers that are banned are sorted at the bottom of the list
- if the router list is sorted and a router is selected, the list will be scrolled to place it in the center of the visible area
- if Tor is started, "Start Tor" becomes "Stop Tor" (requested by TT)
- new configuration option: WindowPos, which is used to store the size and position of the main dialog; this option is used only if it describes a window that has no parts outside the visible area of the screen (requested by TT)
- directory connections now have an exclusivity key EXCLUSIVITY_DIRCONN and internal connections have EXCLUSIVITY_INTERNAL
- plugins are not allowed to set EXCLUSIVITY_DIRCONN or EXCLUSIVITY_INTERNAL for accepted client connections (the connection will be closed)
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on February 1st
- updated language strings: 19, 1468, 2671, 2736

2011-01-23 AdvTor 0.2.0.4

- [tor-0.2.1.29] Fix a heap overflow bug where an adversary could cause heap corruption. This bug probably allows remote code execution attacks. Reported by "debuger". Fixes CVE-2011-0427. Bugfix on 0.1.2.10-rc.
- [tor-0.2.1.29] Prevent a denial-of-service attack by disallowing any zlib-compressed data whose compression factor is implausibly high. Fixes part of bug 2324; reported by "doorss".
- [tor-0.2.1.29] Zero out a few more keys in memory before freeing them. Fixes bug 2384 and part of bug 2385. These key instances found by "cypherpunks", based on Andrew Case's report about being able to find sensitive data in Tor's memory space if you have enough permissions. Bugfix on 0.0.2pre9.
- [tor-0.2.1.29] Add a check for SIZE_T_MAX to tor_realloc() to try to avoid underflow errors there too. Fixes the other part of bug 2324.
- [tor-0.2.1.29] Fix a bug where we would assert if we ever had a cached-descriptors.new file (or another file read directly into memory) of exactly SIZE_T_CEILING bytes. Fixes bug 2326; bugfix on 0.2.1.25. Found by doorss.
- [tor-0.2.1.29] Fix some potential asserts and parsing issues with grossly malformed router caches. Fixes bug 2352; bugfix on Tor 0.2.1.27. Found by doorss.

2011-01-22 AdvTor 0.2.0.3

- corrected: if no router descriptors were downloaded, the function choose_good_middle_server() no longer makes a list with excluded routers (used by the circuit builder dialog when estimating new circuits)
- if a single router is selected as exit, the system tray menu option associated with this router will be checked
- the circuit builder dialog has been re-designed; nodes can be edited or added using 3 new dialogs for selecting entry nodes, exit nodes and for selecting middle nodes from the big list of all nodes; details about estimated/inserted nodes are shown as comments
- when selecting a new exit, the selection is added to AdvTor's title before trying to use the selection to estimate new circuits
- updated language strings: 2727, 2728, 2729, 2730

2011-01-05 AdvTor 0.2.0.2

- [tor-0.2.1.28] Fix a remotely exploitable bug that could be used to crash instances of Tor remotely by overflowing on the heap. Remote-code execution hasn't been confirmed, but can't be ruled out. Everyone should upgrade. Bugfix on the 0.1.1 series and later.
- [tor-0.2.1.28] Change IP address and ports for gabelmoo (v3 directory authority).
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on Januray 3th
- corrected: AdvTor.dll did not disconnect the pipe after receiving a command from another instance of AdvTor.exe
- corrected: when TrackHostExits or AddressMap were used, circuit length became CircuitPathLength+1
- added: new options on exit node selection dialog: "close all existing connections" and "expire tracked hosts", which update a new configuration option "IdentityFlags" (both are enabled by default)
- added plugin callback functions that can be used by plugins, and plugin API, as described in plugins.txt (by default, newly added plugins have the rights for all functions enabled)
- new configuration dialog: "Plugins", which allows unloading / reloading / disabling plugins and changing plugin priorities and rights
- plugins can host hidden services without the need to open any ports on local machine; an example of a hidden service plugin is included in the source code archive (HiddenMessage.dll)
- the hidden service selection dialog allows selecting hidden services hosted by plugins, if any; a plugin can host different hidden services
- added: new plugin Blacklist.dll, which allows banning blacklisted routers and rejecting requests for addresses that resolve to a blacklisted IP
- the default value for FavoriteExitNodesPriority was changed from 100 to 50
- the default value for EnforceDistinctSubnets was changed from 1 to 2 (now the default is to use nodes from different countries in the same circuit)
- updated language strings: 2694, 2695, 2696, 2697, 2698, 2699, 2700, 2701, 2702, 2703, 2704, 2705, 2706, 2707, 2708, 2709, 2710, 2711, 2712, 2713, 2714, 2715, 2716, 2717, 2718, 2719, 2720, 2721, 2722, 2723, 2724, 2725, 2726

2010-12-05 AdvTor v0.2.0.1

- corrected: when a NotifyFilter string was edited manually, the string returned by WideCharToMultiByte was not terminated correctly
- corrected: when no NotifyFilter strings were added, a null pointer was used with SetDlgItemTextL when initializing the "System" dialog
- corrected: the dialog that asks for the private key of a hidden service did not show the last letter of the hidden service's name (thanks to cc for reporting this problem)
- corrected: when adding a new hidden service, the virtual ports were overwritten when registering the new service (thanks to cc for reporting this problem)
- corrected: the prototype of ShowOpenPorts was changed to allow the caller to specify a parent dialog window and the dialog that contains the edit boxes that need to be changed (thanks to cc for reporting this problem)
- new option for intercepting processes: "Exclusive exit", which determines AdvTor to always use exit nodes that are different than the exits used by other processes, to make sure that same exit node cannot know what different processes opened by same user are doing (default is off)
- each intercepted process has a new generated exclusivity key, which, if used, is inherited by child processes; a child process will use the exit nodes used by parent process if possible, or new exits that are not used by processes that have different exclusivity keys
- a process that is not intercepted or that was intercepted without using the exclusivity key has a default exclusivity key which causes its newly chosen exits to exclude exits associated with other keys
- if a process uses an exclusivity key and a single exit node is selected for all connections, that process will exclude selected exit node and use a different one
- if a process uses an exclusivity key and a random exit node from a country is selected for all connections, that process will always use a node from that country that is not already used by processes with different exclusivity keys or it will fail to choose an exit node
- if an exclusivity key is used, it will be shown in debug when a process is intercepted and when an intercepted process creates a new process
- updated language strings: 0100, 2693

2010-12-03 AdvTor v0.2.0.0

- [tor-0.2.1.27] Resolve an incompatibility with OpenSSL 0.9.8p and OpenSSL 1.0.0b: No longer set the tlsext_host_name extension on server SSL objects; but continue to set it on client SSL objects. Our goal in setting it was to imitate a browser, not a vhosting server. Fixes bug 2204; bugfix on 0.2.1.1-alpha. (tortls.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Do not log messages to the controller while shrinking buffer freelists. Doing so would sometimes make the controller connection try to allocate a buffer chunk, which would mess up the internals of the freelist and cause an assertion failure. Fixes bug 1125; fixed by Robert Ransom. Bugfix on 0.2.0.16-alpha. (buffers.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Learn our external IP address when we're a relay or bridge, even if we set PublishServerDescriptor to 0. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha, where we introduced bridge relays that don't need to publish to be useful. Fixes bug 2050. (config.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Allow handshaking OR connections to take a full KeepalivePeriod seconds to handshake. Previously, we would close them after IDLE_OR_CONN_TIMEOUT (180) seconds, the same timeout as if they were open. Bugfix on 0.2.1.26; fixes bug 1840. Thanks to mingw-san for analysis help. (main.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] When you're using bridges and your network goes away and your bridges get marked as down, recover when you attempt a new socks connection (if the network is back), rather than waiting up to an hour to try fetching new descriptors for your bridges. Bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha; fixes bug 1981. (circuitbuild.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Fix an assertion failure that could occur in directory caches or bridge users when using a very short voting interval on a testing network. Diagnosed by Robert Hogan. Fixes bug 1141; bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. (networkstatus.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Enforce multiplicity rules when parsing annotations. Bugfix on 0.2.0.8-alpha. Found by piebeer. (routerparse.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Exit nodes didn't recognize EHOSTUNREACH as a plausible error code, and so sent back END_STREAM_REASON_MISC. Clients now recognize a new stream ending reason for this case: END_STREAM_REASON_NOROUTE. Servers can start sending this code when enough clients recognize it. Bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc; fixes part of bug 1793. (or.h, reasons.c, relay.c)
- [tor-0.2.1.27] Set up maatuska (run by Linus Nordberg) as the eighth v3 directory authority. (dlg_authorities.c)
- corrected: the version of AdvTor.dll was not correctly verified
- geoip_c.h was updated with GeoIPCountryWhois.csv released on November 2nd
- AdvTor.dll now keeps a cache with connection information received from intercepted processes
- if an intercepted program keeps its own DNS cache and the process is released then re-intercepted, a warning will be shown when a connection attempt is made for a fake IP given by a previous instance of AdvTor.dll

- client-side HTTP header filtering has been improved; "proxy-connection" is converted to "connection"; "connection: keep-alive" is replaced with "Connection: Close"; the following headers are removed: "x-forwarded-for", "via", "from", "proxy*" and "keep-alive"
- all settings from all pages from main dialog window were moved to separate child dialogs; to improve startup time, AdvTor will only create and initialize a child dialog window when there is a need to show it
- all procedures from dlg.h, dlg_bridges.h, dlg_graph.h and dlg_lang.h were moved to separate files that have procedures for child dialog windows; the procedures for the main dialog were moved to dlg_main.c; the procedures for the "Proxy" dialog were moved to dlg_proxy.c; the procedures for the "Authorities" dialog were moved to dlg_authorities.c; the procedures for the "Router restrictions" dialog were moved to dlg_routerres.c; the procedures for the "Circuit build" dialog were moved to dlg_circuitbuild.c; the procedures for the "Connections" dialog were moved to dlg_connections.c; the procedures for the "Bypass ISP filtering" dialog were moved to dlg_bridges.c; the procedures for the "Hidden services" dialog were moved to dlg_hs.c; the procedures for the "System" dialog were moved to dlg_system.c; the procedures for the "Force TOR" dialog were moved to dlg_forcetor.c; the procedures for the "Become a Server" dialog were moved to dlg_server.c; the procedures for the "Network information" dialog were moved to dlg_netinfo.c; the procedures for the "Debug" dialog were moved to dlg_debug.c; the procedures for the "About" dialog were moved to dlg_about.c; the procedures for the "Select an Exit Node" dialog were moved to dlg_routers.c;

- new configuration option: ForceFlags - used to specify the default options for faking local time, address IPs and for disallowing non-TCP sockets
- new option: "Run" available on "Force TOR" page that allows starting a process protected by AdvTor
- new option: "Resolve only to fake IPs" available on "Force TOR" page, which if enabled, returns an IP within range 127.16.* for all resolve requests instead of sending them to OR network; cache entries that have 127.16.* as IPs don't expire as long as resolving to fake IPs is enabled
- new option: "Disallow non TCP sockets" available on "Force TOR" page, to protect against leaking the real IP through other protocols
- new menu: "Quick start" available on "Force TOR" page and on system tray menu that allows starting applications protected by AdvTor with different settings for each favorite process (requested by Meka][Meka)

- if no running exit nodes can be found for selected country, the notification message is shown only once, until a good exit node is found (thanks to RoLex for reporting this problem)
- the confusing message "attempt to bypass proxy settings" is replaced with "redirecting connection from address" (thanks to Meka][Meka for reporting this problem)
- system tray menu has a new submenu "Release" with all intercepted processes to allow unloading AdvTor.dll from them
- AdvTor.dll now shows more information about interception failures
- AdvTor.dll no longer loads user32.dll in intercepted processes
- AdvTor.dll also intercepts functions gethostbyname, WSAAsyncGetHostByName, gethostbyaddr, WSAAsyncGetHostByAddr (Windows 2000+), getnameinfo, GetNameInfoW, getaddrinfo, GetAddrInfoW (Windows XP SP2+) (thanks to RoLex for helping with tests)
- programs that are intercepted by AdvTor will have all DNS queries and reverse DNS queries resolved by OR network
- programs that are intercepted can access .onion addresses, AdvTor.dll will resolve them to an IP within range 127.16.* (localhost) and will keep a cache with geneated IPs and corresponding .onion addresses to use in connection requests
- process tree also shows PID values when selecting a window
- when AdvTor.dll sends a notification about an intercepted process that doesn't respect proxy settings, it also shows the PID for that process (requested by RoLex)
- the lists with exit nodes will also have an entry "no exit", for those who want only to see where an intercepted program would connect, but without allowing it to connect or to send anything
- added verification for "localhost" so an intercepted process won't try to use OR network to resolve it (Opera resolves "localhost" every time you save a file)
- added verification for "wpad" to prevent vulnerable applications from using OR network to resolve it (Chrome, IE, Yahoo Messenger, etc.)

2010-08-21 AdvTor v0.1.0.4
