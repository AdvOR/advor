{LANG_DLG_INTERCEPT,"Some applications have installed extensions / scripting languages that can be abused to bypass proxy restrictions to reveal your real IP. To make sure an application always uses its proxy settings, the application is intercepted and Winsock calls are redirected to AdvOR.dll.\r\n\r\n\t\t1. Quick Start\r\n\t\"Quick Start\" is a list of favorite programs that Advanced Onion Router can start and intercept at startup. Each program can have its own private sandboxing settings. All program-specific sandboxing restrictions apply, and all programs started from the \"Quick Start\" menus / command line / window cannot access any real information that is restricted by these settings.\r\n\tThis is the \"safe\" way to start a program.\r\n\r\n\t\t2. Processes\r\n\tThe list of processes allows a quick way to release an intercepted process and/or to intercept a program that was started before starting Advanced Onion Router, or a program that is allowed to have have non-OR network activities during the same session. While sandboxing restrictions apply, the program may already have some restricted information it got before these restrictions were applied and it may send restricted information through the OR network. If you are not sure the program doesn't leak any information that can be used to uniquely identify you, consider starting it via \"Quick Start\".\r\n\r\n\t\t3. Sandboxing\r\n\tSandboxing restrictions are used when a new process is intercepted. When a program is added to the \"Quick Start\" list, current sandboxing options are saved as the default settings for intercepting that program. To change the settings for an existing \"Quick Start\" entry, remove the program from the \"Quick Start\" list, change sandboxing options and re-add it. When using the \"Processes\" window to intercept an existing process, current sandboxing settings are used."},
