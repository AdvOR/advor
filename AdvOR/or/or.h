/**
 * A circuit is a path over the onion routing
 * network. Applications can connect to one end of the circuit, and can
 * create exit connections at the other end of the circuit. AP and exit
 * connections have only one circuit associated with them (and thus these
 * connection types are closed when the circuit is closed), whereas
 * OR connections multiplex many circuits at once, and stay standing even
 * when there are no circuits running over them.
 *
 * A circuit_t structure can fill one of two roles.  First, a or_circuit_t
 * links two connections together: either an edge connection and an OR
 * connection, or two OR connections.  (When joined to an OR connection, a
 * circuit_t affects only cells sent to a particular circID on that
 * connection.  When joined to an edge connection, a circuit_t affects all
 * data.)

 * Second, an origin_circuit_t holds the cipher keys and state for sending data
 * along a given circuit.  At the OP, it has a sequence of ciphers, each
 * of which is shared with a single OR along the circuit.  Separate
 * ciphers are used for data going "forward" (away from the OP) and
 * "backward" (towards the OP).  At the OR, a circuit has only two stream
 * ciphers: one for data going forward, and one for data going backward.
